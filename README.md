# npm-search

ðŸ—¿ NPM => Algolia replication.

## Usage

```sh
yarn
apiKey=... yarn start
```

Available env variables (see [config.js](./config.js)):
- appId
- apiKey
- indexName
- maximumConcurrency: How many packages to save at the same time to Algolia
- registryEndpoint: NPM registry endpoint
- reset: force replication to start over, useful in dev (reset=true yarn start..)

## Flow and status

The goal being: provide an always up to date search in term of data.

1. If there's an initial replication, throw, ask to run via reset (we cannot ensure any process failed)
2. If the initial replication is done, go to 6.
3. Save the current seq of the npm registry inside Algolia settings user data
4. Start initial replication
5. When initial replication is done, save that state in Algolia settings user data
6. Start watching the repository at the last seq.
7. Everytime there's a change, replicate it to Algolia and save new seq

Done: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Next steps:
- Use https://replicate.npmjs.com/registry
- https://replicate.npmjs.com/registry/_all_docs?include_docs=true
- include docs, stream like, use normalize, then watch
